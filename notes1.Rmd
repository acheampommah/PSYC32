List all my files in this folder beginning with `cu`:

```{bash notes1-1}
ls cu*
```

Load up the Tidyverse:

```{r notes1-2}
library(tidyverse)
```


Read in and display the sleep data:

```{r notes1-3}
my_url="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/sleep.txt"
sleep=read_delim(my_url," ")
sleep
```

Make a scatterplot for predicting `atst` from `age`, with a smooth trend:

```{r notes1-4}
ggplot(sleep,aes(x=age,y=atst))+geom_point()+geom_smooth()+
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of average total sleep time against age","Sleep time in minutes")
```

The trend is downward, fairly strong and more or less linear.
