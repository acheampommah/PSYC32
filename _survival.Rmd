## Packages

```{r survival-1}
library(tidyverse)
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(broom)
```

## Read in dance data

```{r survival-2}
dance=read_table("dancing.txt")
dance
```

```{r survival-3}
mth=with(dance,Surv(Months,Quit))
str(mth)
print.default(mth)
```

is it crossing instead of expand.grid?

```{r survival-4}
ages=c(20,40)
treatments=c("no","yes")
crossing(age=ages,treatment=treatments)
```
