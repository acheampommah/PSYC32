# Multi-way frequency analysis

## Packages 

```{r 20190403-1}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Eyewear

slide 660

data

```{r 20190403-2}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/eyewear.txt"
eyewear=read_delim(my_url," ")
eyewear
```

not tidy! Columns are *levels* of a categorical variable `eyewear`, so

```{r 20190403-3}
(eyewear %>% gather(eyewear, frequency, -gender) -> eyes)
```

Modelling-friendly "long" format.

Introduce ways to get from long data to frequency and proportion tables:

```{r 20190403-4}
xtabs(frequency~gender+eyewear, data=eyes)
```

`prop.table` takes output from `xtabs` and works out row/column/layer proportions:

```{r 20190403-5}
xtabs(frequency~gender+eyewear, data=eyes) %>% 
  prop.table(margin=1) 
```

1 is rows, 2 is columns, etc. "Out of people of each gender, what proportion wore...?"

## Modelling

The model is a generalization of a chi-squared test for independence. It is a generalized linear model with `poisson` family (and log link), and thus is called a log-linear model. Note that we fit *all* interactions (and then see what we can remove):

```{r 20190403-6}
eyes.1=glm(frequency~gender*eyewear, data=eyes, family="poisson")
drop1(eyes.1, test="Chisq")
```

The only thing we could remove, the `gender`-`eyewear` interaction, is significant, so cannot remove it. Here we stop.

In context of log-linear model, there is *association* between gender and eyewear. We then investigate with `prop.table`:

```{r 20190403-7}
xtabs(frequency~gender+eyewear, data=eyes) %>% 
  prop.table(margin=1) 
```

More of the females wear contacts, and more of the males wear glasses. That's the reason for the association.

Suppose things had been as below:

```{r 20190403-8}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/eyewear2.txt"
eyewear2=read_table(my_url)
eyewear2
```

The *proportions* of males and females wearing each kind of eyewear are very similar:

```{r 20190403-9}
eyes2 = eyewear2 %>% gather(eyewear, frequency, -gender)
xtabs(frequency~gender+eyewear,data=eyes2) %>% 
  prop.table(margin=1)
```

so there should now be no association:

```{r 20190403-10}
eyes.2=glm(frequency~gender*eyewear,data=eyes2,
family="poisson")
drop1(eyes.2,test="Chisq")
```

Take out interaction:

```{r 20190403-11}
eyes.3=update(eyes.2, .~.-gender:eyewear)
drop1(eyes.3, test="Chisq")
```

```{r 20190403-12}
xtabs(frequency~gender, data=eyes2)
```

There are more females overall (gender effect), and

```{r 20190403-13}
xtabs(frequency~eyewear, data=eyes2)
```

there are more people wearing contacts overall (eyewear effect).

## Chest pain, being overweight, being a smoker

slide 670

```{r 20190403-14}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/ecg.txt"
chest=read_delim(my_url," ")
chest
```

Modelling

```{r 20190403-15}
chest.1=glm(count~ecg*bmi*smoke, data=chest, family="poisson")
drop1(chest.1,test="Chisq")
```

3-way interaction can come out:

```{r 20190403-16}
chest.2=update(chest.1, .~.-ecg:bmi:smoke)
drop1(chest.2,test="Chisq")
```

`bmi:smoke` has largest P-value, just larger than 0.05, so remove it. (What will happen to `ecg:smoke`?)

```{r 20190403-17}
chest.3=update(chest.2, .~.-bmi:smoke)
drop1(chest.3,test="Chisq")
```

`ecg:smoke` became significant, so here we stop.

Interpretation: `ecg` is outcome, so look for associations with that (there are two):

```{r 20190403-18}
xtabs(count~ecg+bmi, data=chest) %>% 
  prop.table(margin=2)
```

Most normal-weight people had normal ecg, but more overweight people had abnormal ecg.

`ecg:smoke`:

```{r 20190403-19}
xtabs(count~ecg+smoke, data=chest) %>% 
  prop.table(margin=2)
```

Most non-smokers had normal ecg, but the smokers were about 50-50 normal and abnormal.

For `prop.table`, if you have a response, make the other thing(s) add up to 1.

## Airlines example

slide 677

```{r 20190403-20}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/airlines.txt"
airlines=read_table2(my_url)
airlines
```

Data tidying

```{r 20190403-21}
airlines %>%
  gather(line.status,freq, contains("_")) %>%
  separate(line.status,c("airline","status")) -> punctual
```

```{r 20190403-22}
punctual
```


Proportions delayed by airline

```{r 20190403-23}
xtabs(freq~airline+status, data=punctual) %>% 
  prop.table(margin=1)
```

This is the 13% and 11% we got before.

Proportion delayed by each airline and airport:

```{r 20190403-24}
xtabs(freq~airline+airport+status, data=punctual) %>% 
  prop.table(margin=c(1,2))
```

slide 682

Log-linear modelling:

```{r 20190403-25}
punctual.1=glm(freq~airport*airline*status,
  data=punctual,family="poisson")
drop1(punctual.1,test="Chisq")
```

3-way interaction comes out:

```{r 20190403-26}
punctual.2=update(punctual.1,~.-airport:airline:status)
drop1(punctual.2,test="Chisq")
```

So now we have three two-way associations to understand. Think of `status` as a response to airline and airport:

```{r 20190403-27}
xtabs(freq~airline+status, data=punctual) %>% prop.table(margin=1)
```

Overall percent delayed. Saw this before.

```{r 20190403-28}
xtabs(freq~airport+status, data=punctual) %>% prop.table(margin=1)
```

Flights into some airports (San Francisco, Seattle) often delayed, into Phoenix usually on time.

```{r 20190403-29}
xtabs(freq~airport+airline, data=punctual) %>% prop.table(margin=2)
```

What percent of each airline's flights are to each airport. Alaska Airlines flies mostly to Seattle, America West mostly to Phoenix.

## Ovarian cancer

slide 689

```{r 20190403-30}
my_url="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/cancer.txt"
cancer=read_delim(my_url," ")
cancer
```

```{r 20190403-31}
cancer.1=glm(freq~stage*operation*xray*survival,
  data=cancer,family="poisson")
drop1(cancer.1,test="Chisq")
```

```{r 20190403-32}
cancer.2=update(cancer.1, .~.-stage:operation:xray:survival)
drop1(cancer.2,test="Chisq")
```

```{r 20190403-33}
cancer.3=update(cancer.2,.~.-stage:xray:survival)
  drop1(cancer.3,test="Chisq")
```

```{r 20190403-34}
cancer.4=update(cancer.3,.~.-operation:xray:survival)
drop1(cancer.4,test="Chisq")
```

```{r 20190403-35}
cancer.5=update(cancer.4,.~.-xray:survival)
drop1(cancer.5,test="Chisq")
```

```{r 20190403-36}
cancer.6=update(cancer.5,.~.-stage:operation:survival)
drop1(cancer.6,test="Chisq")
```

```{r 20190403-37}
cancer.7=update(cancer.6,.~.-operation:survival)
drop1(cancer.7,test="Chisq")
```

finally done!

Response variable is `survival`, and the only remaining thing associated with that is `stage`:

```{r 20190403-38}
xtabs(freq~survival+stage, data=cancer) %>% prop.table(margin=2)
```

Most of the people with early-stage cancer survived, and most people with advanced-stage cancer did not.

Operation or x-ray had no effect on survival.
