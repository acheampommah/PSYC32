Compare one drug with\nanother on same person, removes a lot of variability due to differences between people. \n\n- Matched pairs, requires different analysis.\n      \n- Design: randomly choose 6 of 12 subjects to get drug A first, other 6\nget drug B first.\n\n## Packages\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(smmr) # for a sign test later\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Reading the data\nValues aligned in columns:  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_url <- \n  \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/analgesic.txt\"\npain <- read_table(my_url)\npain\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 12 x 3\n   subject druga drugb\n     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n 1       1   2     3.5\n 2       2   3.6   5.7\n 3       3   2.6   2.9\n 4       4   2.6   2.4\n 5       5   7.3   9.9\n 6       6   3.4   3.3\n 7       7  14.9  16.7\n 8       8   6.6   6  \n 9       9   2.3   3.8\n10      10   2     4  \n11      11   6.8   9.1\n12      12   8.5  20.9\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Paired *t*-test \n\n\\small\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith(pain, t.test(druga, drugb, paired = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tPaired t-test\n\ndata:  druga and drugb\nt = -2.1677, df = 11, p-value = 0.05299\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -4.29941513  0.03274847\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      -2.133333 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\\normalsize\n\n- P-value is 0.053. \n- Not quite evidence of difference between drugs.\n\n## t-testing the differences\n\n- Likewise, you can calculate the differences yourself and\nthen do a 1-sample t-test on them.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npain %>% mutate(diff = druga - drugb) -> pain\npain\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 12 x 4\n   subject druga drugb    diff\n     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1       1   2     3.5  -1.5  \n 2       2   3.6   5.7  -2.1  \n 3       3   2.6   2.9  -0.300\n 4       4   2.6   2.4   0.200\n 5       5   7.3   9.9  -2.6  \n 6       6   3.4   3.3   0.100\n 7       7  14.9  16.7  -1.80 \n 8       8   6.6   6     0.600\n 9       9   2.3   3.8  -1.5  \n10      10   2     4    -2    \n11      11   6.8   9.1  -2.3  \n12      12   8.5  20.9 -12.4  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## t-test on the differences\n- then throw them into t.test, testing that the mean is zero, with\nsame result as before:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith(pain, t.test(diff, mu = 0))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  diff\nt = -2.1677, df = 11, p-value = 0.05299\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -4.29941513  0.03274847\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n-2.133333 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- Same P-value (0.053) and conclusion.\n\n## Assessing normality \n- 1-sample and 2-sample t-tests assume (each) group normally\ndistributed.\n- Matched pairs analyses assume (theoretically) that differences\nnormally distributed.\n- How to assess normality?
