This is my title.
========================================================

Here is some random data.

```{r thingy-1}
x=rnorm(100)
x
```

This is a random formula:
$$z^2=x^2+y^2+{x \over 2 \sin x}$$

Here are some plots, for example:

```{r thingy-2}
plot(x)
hist(x,prob=T)
lines(density(x))
```

How normal is this?

```{r thingy-3}
qqnorm(x)
qqline(x)
```

I'd say that's pretty normal.
