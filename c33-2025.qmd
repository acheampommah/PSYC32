sitting outside on the long curved seat for a change of scene. Not sure how long I will stay awake.

ideas:

- R studio connection and quarto docs
- graphs (including normal quantile?)
- numerical summaries
- choosing stuff (dplyr)
- inference (faster):
  - 1-sample
  - 2-sample
  - matched pairs
- assumptions
- bootstrap with CIs and simulation (same or different sections?)
- functions here?
- tidying
- sign test, mood median
- anova as now
- regression as now
- stan as now

new stuff needed

- abbreviated version of normal-theory inference
- a new intro to functions
- coherent bootstrap and simulation

think about how I am making it more challenging (maybe it's mostly more stuff in less time).

is there room for more computationally-intensive stuff? (find out about what might be useful). Make a big deal about simulation.
